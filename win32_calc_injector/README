=== calculator injector

This is just a demonstration of Win32 DLL injection to a process.

First, we create the calc process by CreateProcess("C:\Windows\system32\calc.exe",..), then
we allocate RW memory of size strlen(dll_name) in the calc process with VirtualAllocEx().
WriteProcessMemory() writes the string to the allocated memory. CreateRemoteThread() is executed
at LoadLibraryA kernel API and loads the DLL. 

$ D:\_WORK\dev>inject.exe
[OK] CreateProcess C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe
[OK] VirtualAllocEx to 0x00080000
[OK] WriteProcessMememory to 0x00080000 :: "inject.dll",10
[OK] CreateRemoteThread at 0x00080000 :: LoadLibrary("inject.dll")
