=== idt

WARN: CONFIG_STRICT_DEVMEM must not be set in /usr/src/linux/.config

$ grep DEVMEM /usr/src/linux/.config

Don't use

__asm__ volatile("sidt %0" : "=m"(idtr));

for IDT address, just for the limit since I am on a VM.

"Reading the IDTR will unfortunately not work inside most
virtual machines. Because the lidt instruction is a protected
instruction, an exception will be generated that the VM will catch.
This allows the VM to keep a virtual IDTR for each operating system.
Since the sidt instruction is not handled, it will return a bogus address
for the IDTR, usually above 0xffc00000. [1]"

Rather set IDT address manually from /boot/System.map*
and set the idtr limit to 0x7ff.

$ grep idt_table /boot/System.map*
